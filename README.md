# FixMath

FixMath is a library to perform [fixed point arithmetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_arithmetic). It uses integer types internally to provide fast computations of decimal numbers. As most micro-controllers do not have a floating point unit (FPU), this library allows fast computation of fractionnal numbers without resorting to floats.
