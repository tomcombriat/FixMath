/* Three mappers are available, depending on their expected speed and precision. All of them only have a division on the setBounds() part, making the map() highly efficient as it only uses multiplications.
 - FixMathMapperFull is the most accurate and uses invFull. It is the slowest (depending on platforms/types used, this might be equivalent).
 - FixMathMapperAccurate might be faster the FixMapperFull in some cases, with only a slight loss of precision.
 - FixMathMapperFast is the fastest, but might heavily digitize the output... Pick your weapon!
